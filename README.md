WireMock.NET workshop
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [WireMock.NET](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net), here are all the materials from a workshop I've delivered in Java, using [the original Java WireMock library](https://wiremock.org), which has now been ported to C#. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

What topics are covered?
---
This workshop covers the following topics:
* An introduction to service virtualization
* Getting started with WireMock.NET
* Request matching strategies and fault simulation 
* Creating stateful mocks
* Response templating

How does it work?
---
You can go through all of the materials in your own time, at your own pace. The slides explain the concepts, and you can use the exercises to practice those concepts yourself.

All exercises come with RestSharp-based tests that verify the implementation of your mocks. The answers to the exercises are supplied as a reference.

I've taken care of all the setup, so there shouldn't be a need to configure anything. 

What do I need?
---
.NET 6 and an IDE of your choice. That's it.

Slides
---
The .odp, .pdf and .pptx files in the root folder contain all slides from the workshop. Again, feel free to use, share and adapt them to fit your own requirements.

Comments? Saying thanks?

Feel free to file an issue here or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I'd rather have you deliver the workshop instead...

Sure, I'd love to. Again, send me an email and I'll be happy to discuss options. In house, online, or at your conference, I'm sure we can work something out.
